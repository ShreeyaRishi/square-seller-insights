Their escalation gets no response. I’m sitting here unable to run my business for 2 weeks now simply because they do not provide timely support. Even when they do reply after several days, none of their emails allow for a reply so you can’t contact them.

cazoolio,1,⭐ 1 Star — Shopify Is Holding My Money For 4 months and Has Zero Real Support,"PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING
I worked extremely hard to earn $800 through my Shopify website, only for Shopify to **hold my funds for months**. After waiting nearly **three months**, I finally received **$600**, but Shopify is still **holding $200**. My payout was originally scheduled for **October 28**, and it’s now **November 10** — still nothing.

My website was doing amazing — within just two days of launching, I made $800. Then Shopify suddenly **terminated my store**, claiming I wasn’t “legitimate.” That’s completely untrue. I have **three valid state business licenses** that legally allow me to operate, and all were clearly listed on my website for compliance. Instead of asking for verification or documentation, Shopify just shut me down and froze my funds without explanation.

After months of trying to prove my legitimacy, Shopify finally reactivated my account — but when I logged in, I was told to **update my banking info**, which required me to **pay for another subscription** just to access it. That’s another **$40 gone** on top of everything else.

Now my payout has been pushed to **November 15**, after already being delayed from **October 28**, and based on how this has gone, I doubt I’ll get it on time or even at all.

To make things worse, there is **no real customer support**. Just an **AI chat box** that can’t help with real issues, and an **email support system that never responds**. I’ve sent multiple emails and received no help or updates. It’s frustrating, disheartening, and completely unprofessional. 

I’m a parent of **three children**, and this situation has been financially and emotionally exhausting. I’m the only one working, and I’ve had to stop all business operations while waiting for Shopify to release money that I rightfully earned. Holding someone’s income this long — especially after proving compliance — is unacceptable and feels borderline illegal. My sales included service which required some labor work to be done. Making it feel very illegal.

At this point, all I can do is share my experience and leave this **hard-earned 1-star review**, because Shopify has given me no other option. I’m now looking for another platform that values its merchants, provides **real human support**, and doesn’t hold small business owners’s money hostage.",2025-11-10T07:38:18-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

Real stores done even deal with Shopify. This platform was bait us into the billing/subscription’s. Why do I need 30 different subscriptions for one store? That’s not making since, and then why is the billing so difficult to navigate? Everything supposed to be one, two steps right? Not with billing they keep telling to me to uninstall the app you won’t be charged…SCAM yes yu will still be charged because it’s an extra step they don’t tell yu, yu have to reach out to the third party app lol.

Trendz and Gemz,1,Shopify is going downhill big time,"Over 3 years with shopify 2 stores… one is a multimillion dollar a year store so it’s not like we don’t know what we are doing. These last couple updates are an absolute mess and making us dream of another company to go with. The map is worse than ever for looking at live view. (I could handle living without this feature tho, it’s not a deal breaker)  The scanners that we loved on mobile are pretty much now useless and this is not just an iOS thing because it doesn’t work on our android devices either. Well I should say it works when it feels like it. This update 6 days ago is by far the worst update ever. It’s beyond frustrating that shopify launches this disaster and we are basically just testers I guess. It must be a “put it out there and hope for the best” mentality. How in the world did they not test this update to see if it works BEFORE making us all update. Have you ever heard of beta testers shopify?!? I’m not interested in being one of them when we pay thousands a month to run our store with you. Now when you type in an item number you have to type one letter and wait, then another letter and wait. If you type at normal speed (heck even slow speed) it’s like the sku can not at all recognize what your typing and back tracks deleting anything you have typed . Then once you get past that nonsense you have to click save over and over. Doesn’t anyone try to simplify an store owners clicks??? Less clicks means time savings and when your running a warehouse time savings is SUPER important.  You now need to click the save button just to go to the sku. When inputting products it’s taking at least 4-5 times longer. What used to take me 1-2 mins per listing is now taking 7-10 mins per list at least. We get in thousands of skus so THIS extra time is a mess for us. Not to mention beyond frustrating trying to teach our staff the “bugs”  There truly isn’t enough space here to write all the bugs and I wouldn’t use the App Store as a way to complain to shopify if I could get a human who cared. When you do get through to customer support they find every reason possible that it’s OUR fault. They tell you they will elevate it to higher up tech support. I literally laugh now every time they send me that sentence in chat.  That new search bar you implemented…. Who’s crazy idea was this? Why in the world would any store owner want to randomly search orders OUT OF ORDER?!?! If I want to search products I don’t want to see orders with those products and vice versa. I gotta wonder who in the world comes up with these lovely ideas and obviously they aren’t themselves running any type of business. Why not reach out to owners to ask them what they would like to see.

EishaPeisha,1,Problem After Probelm,"From taking money (($120))  from me when they offered an additonal 3 months $1//month and my website isn’t even up yet….

There have been constant problems with their software, their tech, their deposits, their apps… but you know what magically works, them TAKING your money, that seems to work well!!

I’ve had to reach out to “support” who was of no help. From getting transferred in the middle of “getting help” to not getting help in the end. To getting an email offer of “extend your trial another 3 months for $1” showing proof of the email & still getting charged another $120. 

From ALL the ads they have online, on social media, even on TV but can seem to help the small companies out. They love hosting SHEIN and major companies but Heaven forbid a small shop tries to get started. They’ll nickel & dime you from the jump but throw pretty sayings like “it only takes 30 minutes to set up your website & start selling” or “pay” influencers to do it for them. It’s all LIES. I’ve been trying to open my site since JANUARY. It’s now JULY & im STILL not there due to glitches they can’t seem to fix. The solution!? Pay $500 for one of their “premium” pages, that’s literally the same as the free ones, they just hold your hand & walk you through the set up in “30 minutes” or so they claim.

Would love to hear from someone who had their entire site up & running in 30 minutes.

If Shopify shuts down your account and they require a whole bunch of documentation, and ask you to link your bank account to prove your business, DO NOT DO IT!!!! That is a scam. They will refuse your claim anyway and they will use the information you provided to WITHDRAW MONEY FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. THIS COMPANY IS CRIMINAL AND THE OWNER SHOULD BE IN JAIL. 

I just got scammed by SHOPIFY. I have about $10000 in payout and Shopify completely SHUT DOWN my account suddenly. I don’t even have access to my information, they simply deleted everything. MY MONEY IS GONE. They claimed I could send an appeal and I would have access to the payout IN FOUR MONTHS. They scam users to keep our money!!! They are NOT RELIABLE.

I was incorrectly billed a one-time upfront fee of $953, even though I repeatedly informed them that I wanted to be on a monthly payment plan. Despite my efforts, they continued to send me the same bill for almost two months, and they are still billing me without ever resolving the issue.

It was nearly impossible to speak to anyone directly — communication was limited to automated AI responses and chat agents. One representative would say they could fix the problem, only for another to later claim they could not.

The photos ALWAYS upload in reverse order to what is selected.  It’s necessary to try to move them back in the intended order, and half the time, the app won’t allow you to do that.  And even when you get them in the correct intended order, when the listing saves, it reverts the photos.  This update or “enhancement” is insane, and not in a good way.  I am going to be cancelling my Shopify account due to this issue, as well as the price increase we suffered last year.

Tommy-Texan,1,Avoid Shopify – They Enable Unethical Billing Practices and Offer No Real Support,"I had a store with Shopify and installed an app called “Minta.” I uninstalled it on the very last day of the free trial, yet Minta still charged me $256 for an entire year’s subscription. Despite multiple disputes submitted to both Minta and Shopify, clearly explaining that I canceled before the trial ended, I was met with threats that my store would be frozen.

After a long chain of emails with Shopify support, I was told that if I paid my next Shopify subscription fee, they would not freeze my account over the dispute with Minta. I complied — and they froze my store anyway. No resolution. No accountability. Just silence.

Shopify clearly does not protect its users from third-party app abuse, and they allow shady developers to charge users fraudulently with no consequences. Their customer support is just a formality, not a real avenue for help.

I strongly discourage anyone from starting a store with Shopify. My experience shows they do not care about fair business practices or their users’ rights. I’m now pursuing legal action in Canada against Shopify and Minta in Israel.",2025-04-13T04:24:06-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

Not to mention it is so easily integratable with all our other programs we would highly recommend Shopify for any business out there whether it’s in person online or e-commerce Shopify will streamline not just your sales but profits and inventory scale altogether and help you to reach more customers by giving them the most convenient way to place a purchase than ever before!",2025-03-21T06:13:15-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

You can’t use the app to add funds cuz it redirects you to your internet app which is also extremely dumb and a hassle.

OliverSMass,1,No communication,"There is no communication with this platform. Emails are rejected. Chat is the only way to look for help. Although it says a 5 minute wait time it’s usually 15 minutes or longer. They don’t respect or value the time of business owners. Responses to emails sent via Shopify are rejected. You cannot call or email for help anymore. The chat box goes round and round with no solutions. I have been with Shopify for seven years. Loyal customers don’t seem to matter. I am looking for other platforms for my business.

UPDATE: The “support” response to this review, had a link that sent me to their support page and the chat, which was part was part of my review and no help AT ALL!
I think their responses are AI generated.

The only other way I can think of to find a solution is to reach out to their CEO on LinkedIn.

On another note, the reviews that said they spoke to someone on the phone is fake.

Shopify’s automated system seems to flag accounts randomly, and their support team offers little to no assistance in resolving the issue. If you’re serious about e-commerce, I strongly recommend looking at alternative platforms like WooCommerce or BigCommerce to avoid the risk of losing your store and funds with no recourse.

I believe once one thinks about how to strategically thinks about time management with the support of technology, in a sustainable fashion about how we can exchange goods & services globally addressing the everyday needs for people and our planet, E-Commerce, to be specific (Shopify) is a great platform to pursue this as you seek to achieve your dreams.

- ""location display limit reached"" is not only stupid when scrolling is available, but further when tapping ""more"" it just leads to a blank screen showing nothing. Good job 👍

RT Electronics,1,Disappointing Experience with Shopify,"I signed up for Shopify’s $1-for-three-months promotion, excited to start my online store. Unfortunately, my experience was far from smooth. For nearly a month, my payouts were not working, which meant I couldn't process sales without potentially losing money. This was extremely frustrating because I was essentially paying for a service that wasn’t fully functional.

When I finally resolved the payout issue, my earnings were quickly taken away by getting charged 41$, leaving me feeling cheated out of the promotional period I should have been able to use to grow my business. I reached out to Shopify, but the response I received did little to compensate for the lost time and opportunities.

Overall, this experience has been disappointing. The promotion promised value that I never fully received due to technical issues, and as a result, I can't recommend Shopify based on my experience.",2024-08-27T17:26:17-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

""Do you think Shopify is a scam? I’ve been impersonated by a store using my personal information and email.

I even used keywords like 'fraud' and 'scam' but got nowhere. It wasn’t until I received threatening emails from customers and Shopify about legal action that I realized the severity. If the CEO, Tobi, earns millions, the least he could do is ensure a support team that helps.

Jonny Candle,1,Shopify WAS Amazing until Post-Covid Shopify,"There was a time when Shopify probably couldn’t be better, but as with all things do, it actually got worse during Covid-19 when all the big corporations decided to shrink quality, fire staff, and increase their prices. 

They’re customer support used to be stellar, unbeatable, and anything could be fixed. Now basic plan users are forced to engage with chat-only support who are blatantly rude and confident that there is nothing that can be done to them. It’s no better with phone support for Shopify Plus upgrade.  Support NEVER has a solution to a problem these days, holding accusatory and defensive tones towards basic inquiries - as if it were the customer’s fault that they lack in-depth knowledge of all things Shopify. And surprise - there’s now a language barrier to make things more complicated. 

The knee-jerk reaction from Shopify Support staff is that whoever is contacting them is looking for a fight, and any question asked is a “gotcha” trap from the customer. I dared to ask any question to expand on vague, scripted responses and was met with condescending, aggressive replies that more than suggested that I, the customer who is not a tech wiz, am the problem. 

No further details are EVER provided about solutions to urgent problems, except for: “this has been escalated”. To who? Regarding what? When should I expect further communication? How will I be contacted? Why is the issue happening in the first place? Nope - if you ask, you’ll get nothing. Days…weeks? “Yup” is there reply, and with a polite version of “screw you” for good measure. The cherry on top is that if you are privileged to call - you get to battle the thickest accents with chickens and other noises in the background. 

Not sure what they might do after this review, but rest assured it’s out there now. 

P.S. the “-ting” sale sound is not as satisfying as a “chuh-ching” sound, by the way. Bring the old Shopify back.",2024-08-11T12:30:30-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

I have spent the last 1.5 years of my own part-time work (ALL my free time), plus a developer to help customize, and still the site is not done. Customer service is spotty at best. They’ve designed a platform with very little customization possible, in spite of promising this as a selling point. They’ll push you to spend extra money either on their “expert developers”, or outside apps that you’ll be locked into subscription fees — just to do basic things like have a form to collect your customers’ phone/addresses. You can expect to pay $10-100 PER EXTRA APP, for the rest of your site’s life. Additionally the site can’t even allow you basic things like to enlarge your logo. If you’re a visual person, it’s a disaster to make anything look good. The images on mobile are cropped at the sides & they don’t see this as a problem. The backend is needlessly complicated.

Country Club Cowgirl,1,"1 month of silence from Shopify and $1,090 has disappeared from my payout account.","I have so far had an absolutely terrible experience, and it is culminating in what seems to be $1,090 stolen from my payout account (and not in Balance either), with no help in sight. 

Back in May I opened up a Shopify store selling Western-inspired golf apparel for women. This went on smoothly for the first month or so. Then, on June 29th I was made aware that my payouts were placed “on hold” and that my next steps were to check my email to find out how to resolve this. Now, the kicker is that my shop was featured in a small magazine article on the 28th of June, so I had about $1,000 in sales tied up in this “hold.” Upon checking my email, I realized I didn’t get one for whatever reason. I then messaged Shopify support, who assured me that this was being handled by the “payments team” and it was routine, and not to worry. This was all around July 1st. It has now been over a month (writing as of August 1st) and I have had no resolution. To boot, the $1,090 that was in my payout account is seemingly GONE. It is not in my Balance App (I have no external accounts linked) and not in my Shopify payout records. It has disappeared. I have messaged support about this 7-8 times over the course of the month and never get an answer. And I pay for a lower tier of Shopify, so I am not entitled to phone support. At this point I believe Shopify has taken my money. I have still NEVER received an email about this (in my spam folder or otherwise.)

QueenStacieD,2,Account Recovery Process Stressful,"Recently I had to get a new phone number, I was able to sign in on my computer but forgot to update the number on my Shopify account. Then to my already stressful life my computer’s hard drive crashed. I was unable to recovery my recovery codes or sign into my Shopify account from my new computer or phone. I contacted Shopify support, which in itself was even more stressful because to reach someone you had to select your store to sign in and I could not. After a few hours, I was finally able to reach someone by chat. I was informed that they would be submitting an account recovery request but there was no timeline on resolution. Two weeks later I got an email to submit documentation to validate that I am the owner. I submitted the documents and hoped that over the next 48-72 hours I would hear something. It has now been another week with no further responses. I am unable to access orders to fulfill, resulting in a loss in revenue which I informed the agent this fact when requesting account recovery. There simply should be a much better process for account recovery with such a large corporation, and business owner’s entire business livelihood attached to the platform. I’m likely going to have to refund any and all sales and possibly have to send out some sort of discount and apology to ensure I retain customers. I am still being charged the fees for a service I can’t use and losing money. I’ve been with Shopify since 2018 and I never considered this process would be so complicated and lengthy. I am now likely going to seek another more reliable platform that considers the urgency for these sort of issues. I suggest saving your recovery codes offline, print them, or save to a cloud platform that you can always access.

Lourdes v,1,Not Seller Friendly,I’m not sure why a platform such as Shopify can not take the time and effort to back the sellers.

We have our return policy clearly written that we do not do refunds unless the piece is damaged at the point of receiving the merchandise and the customer does not want to get it replaced. We offer a 30 day exchange NOT REFUND only if the jewelry is in the same condition as it was when they received it. We’ve had customers place chargebacks AND keep the merchandise and Shopify does not seem to take any conditions towards the seller.

Anonnnn81871926,1,Hold money for no reason,"Shopify is actually a joke. There’s many stories about them holding money for no reason. Well, it happened to me. They emailed me saying they would put a percentage on hold for 120 days due to high percentage of “chargebacks and refunds.” I’ve had zero chargebacks and one refund. This occurred when I started receiving more orders as well. A few months ago they put my payments on hold as well as a “standard review” when I had already had my website for a year. But they did the standard review when I receive a lot of orders once again? So suspicious. It took two weeks for them to take the hold off, and that’s only because I kept nagging them daily about my money or else I don’t think they would have returned it quicker than those 2 weeks. Their customer service is no help- I don’t even think they’re real people at this point. They don’t care about small businesses and how this can affect them, especially when you have proof.

In a clear straight to the point way, basically all the answers I get seem always unsure.

The fact that Shopify no longer has a direct customer service feature is very disheartening.",2024-04-25T09:12:26-07:00,Shopify,Shopify
Phatphlyer,1,Withholding $$,"I’m still waiting on sales money from December 2023. I’ve talked to customer service (chat) several times and they say that the legal department is working on it. I’m dealing with this nameless, faceless entity and not getting anywhere. My account was probably hacked, but withholding my money is wrong. Doing business with Shopify has been horrible. Update- I talked to a chat support advisor today and they were unable (or unwilling not sure) to provide a name and contact person for resolution. They say that my case will be escalated and someone will contact me. However I have had this conversation several times and the result is NO RESULT. Dealing with this big impersonal, nameless, faceless entity has been really terrible.",2024-04-23T21:20:39-07:00,Shopify,Shopify
Honest_Reviews T-T,1,Charging Me For Non-Existent Stores,"I used Shopify for a few months, then switched to Etsy because it was cheaper. I canceled my subscription and deleted my stores. A few months later, I got continued emails from Shopify asking me to pay a bill for 625$! I tried to go into my stores to cancel the subscription again, but I couldn't get into my stores because they don't exist! Shopify doesn't have a support team, only a page directing me to log into my store. I don't know what to do… Shopify, please help me!!",2024-04-22T20:05:03-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

Tito751,1,No Customer Service,"I open an account and for me it was difficult to set up the app to sell items.

I have no way to call and since I deleted everything I can’t get back in to the app because is asking me to sign up again. I don’t want to sign or create another account I just want to stop getting charge again and again.

I have no access to my store, my products, my orders, my livelihood, and am still without any end in sight. I have no idea when I will have my store back.

Sativavie,1,Shopify Neglects its Users and ALLOWS shops to SCAM easily,"Shopify should be responsible for keeping record/information on their shops, just in case the shop is a scammer/not legit. Not having anything to do with your sellers allows businesses to take advantage of their customers and buyers. I ordered for $100 something 6 months ago and have been trying to contact the store as well as Shopify for months trying to figure it out. I cannot receive the product or a refund. I was told I would, but here we are 6 months later.",2024-04-11T07:42:31-07:00,Shopify,Shopify
Dood Broman,2,Worst “customer service” of all time,"Shopify PROFITED $2.8. billion in 2022 but decided to cut the spending on the customer service department. You would think a company this large would expand their customer service department as they profited more and began to service more businesses. Nope not these guys. Instead they got rid of any way to communicate via phone call. Nope, you cannot call when they screw something up to get it fixed. Shopify sent me an incorrect 1099K this year, I’ve reached out 3 times to have it corrected, the first person told me 24-48 hours it would be corrected. This is week 4 and I haven’t even received a follow up email. Corporate greed strikes again.

Its been like this for a week or 2 now. Workaround is I have to open the web version on my phone. Very annoying. PLEASE FIX!!!!!

Also, support paths are terrible. Trying to talk to someone or even submit a support request is NOT possible. Sending me to help center for 24/7 support is a cop out.  Please employee real humans to do your job.",2024-04-03T04:27:36-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

hdisiksbe,1,Shopify has gone downhill,"We’ve had our shopify store for roughly 3 years now. Year 1 support was amazing, multiple contact methods and would get a quick resolution to any potential issues. Year 2 this support started to decline, phone service no longer available and resolution/response times much slower. Now in year 3 any form of support is useless. We have had numerous major issues with our store, with no help or resolutions from shopify support. The only available option is to chat with a representative, who will inform us that they are forwarding the issue to a specialist team and will get back to us within 24 hours….. we have never heard back with a resolution, not ever.  In addition their process for chargebacks is awful, if you receive any form of a chargeback through shopify you are near guaranteed to lose it, regardless of any evidence submitted.",2024-03-24T16:11:22-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

Aki_Tk,3,Very Tedius,"I hate using this app to set things up on my store, if I were to be pithy about it. The app fluidity is above average, but there are sooo many taps in order to get to where you want, and due to the nature of the service, there are just waaaaay too many settings pages to go through, which are easier to see on the desktop. It’s not all. The collection system is a bit of a nightmare because it LOOKS like you can create, edit, add to a collection of products while you’re editing the store look itself, but you have to go back to the inventory editing page to do that. You can’t create and add pages to your store to show a collection without doing this, and I spent ages figuring that out. It’s also very unintuitive how to create a page. You have to create templates and collections ? How do you connect them? I’m frustrated. Otherwise, it’s fine mostly. Some elements are locked away for the phone",2024-03-18T21:21:45-07:00,Shopify,Shopify

I do not want to press on that down arrow and then press on the last 30 days or whatever. Its just a huge inconvenience and i think I speak for others as well that they think the same.

I would MUCH RATHER, it being like it used to be. WHERE YOU COULD JUST PRESS “Today” “Yesterday” “This Week” and “This Month”

Now I’ve bought things for my other children from things for my other children from the same merchant and every time, Shopify sends a code to my son’s phone for verification.  This is annoying and I don’t know how to stop this of change it to MY phone number.

SagarandSagar1994,1,Terrible updates,"I used to use this app regularly as a Shopify plus customer - now I only use desktop. I submitted several bug complaints - no one responds. When you click on an order from a push notification on iOS, the text field doesn’t move up when you try to add a comment so you can see what you’re typing. This does not happen when you open the order by going into the app first - only happens when you directly open the order from the push notification. Also their address field in the order in iOS does not trigger open the native Google maps app like it used to, instead it opens a browser of Google maps from where you click open app. Recent updates have made the app more glitchy and harder to use - I prefer now to just use desktop version but I used to find their app very useful.
