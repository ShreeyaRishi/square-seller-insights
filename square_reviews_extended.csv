Hibunk,5,Square malfunctioning,"The IRS allows individuals, especially sole proprietors, to use their SSN for tax reporting purposes. This simplifies the process for many people starting their own direct selling businesses.
Business Structure:
Many direct sellers operate as sole proprietors, which is the simplest form of business structure. This means they don't need to obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) unless they choose to, such as when they hire employees or want to create a more formal business entity. 

I want to use Square and have the option to utilize my Social Security Number, but it's not compliant with direct selling policies to allow me to do so.

Compliance with Direct Selling Guidelines:

Companies like Mary Kay Inc. are set up to comply with direct selling regulations. Representatives using their SSN adhere to these guidelines, ensuring they operate lawfully.",2026-01-31T11:01:42-07:00,app_store

They made me feel as if they genuinely cared about resolving the issue in a right and timely manner. That always stuck with me and I’ve had people try to convince me to switch from Square but because of the ease of use, the reliability, all the features offered, and the excellent customer service I’ve received… I just can’t see doing business with anyone else.

5 Star Landscaping,1,"Very disappointed- loan money never received, still expected to pay","I took out a loan through Square, but my card was frozen and the loan never actually went through on my end. Despite this, Square’s system shows that I received the money — which I did not.

I have contacted customer support three separate times. Each time, they acknowledged that there is an issue and told me they would contact their loan department and follow up with me by email. No one has followed up, and I’ve received no resolution.

What’s most frustrating is that I’m still expected to pay back a loan for money I never received. This has caused unnecessary stress and wasted hours of my time trying to fix something that should be simple.

For a company handling people’s finances, this level of communication and accountability is unacceptable. Until this is resolved, I cannot recommend Square to anyone.",2026-01-21T23:06:48-07:00,app_store

Bundles6383&,1,Beware of Fraud,"Square allowed my Bank Account Info to be changed to a false bank account and have several fraudulent charges to be made to my customers. 

When I try talking to “Customer Support” they told me to wait 2 days for someone else to contact me (with no solution). Just kept telling me to open a new account and start over. When I did what they said to do after a month of trying to fix my current account, they blocked me and accused me of fraud and told me to take my business  somewhere else. 

I did everything they said. I was polite, patient and followed their directions as their “trained specialists” past me on to the next person 4 times each time I tried to solve the issues at hand.",2026-01-19T15:07:49-07:00,app_store
MaxCon Software,1,Rating: 1/5 (would be 0 if possible),"Square has been one of the worst experiences I’ve had with a payment processor. Their “security measures” on new accounts are excessive, poorly communicated, and operationally destructive. They placed my account under review and held deposits while still allowing payments—meaning they let you take revenue and then prevent you from accessing it to run your business.

Customer service is the real problem:
	•	Lack of communication: No clear explanation, no definitive release date, and shifting timeframes.
	•	Constant lock/review cycle: Every time you comply, the “clock restarts” because they claim they base the review on “the last submission.” That turns into an endless delay.
	•	Repetitive document requests: They ask for the same information repeatedly, even after it’s uploaded through their official system.
	•	No real escalation: Agents claim they can’t connect you to the team reviewing the account. The best you get is “a manager will contact you in 1–2 business days,” which is useless when your funds are frozen and you have contracts to fulfill.

A payment processor’s job is to allow a legitimate business to operate reliably. Square did the opposite—held funds, blocked transfers/deposits, and created chaos with inconsistent support. If you need stability, predictable deposits, and actual account management, look elsewhere.",2026-01-18T18:02:38-07:00,app_store

\o/ swim,1,GARBAGE,"I had an extremely frustrating and damaging experience with Square. Without any real warning or clear explanation, they suddenly placed my account on hold and froze my funds for 180 days. This is money from legitimate work that I already completed, and Square is essentially holding it hostage.

What makes this worse is the complete lack of transparency and support. Every time I called, I got a different answer, no real timeline, and no one who could actually resolve the issue. I submitted all requested documents, verified my identity, and fully cooperated, yet my account remained locked with no meaningful explanation.

As a business owner, this is unacceptable. Square markets itself as being “small-business friendly,” but putting accounts on hold for six months without clear justification can seriously hurt or even destroy a small business. Bills, payroll, and vendors don’t wait 180 days.

Customer service was dismissive, robotic, and unhelpful. There was no urgency, no accountability, and no empathy for the financial impact this caused. Once they have your money, you realize how little power you actually have as a customer.

I would strongly caution any business owner against relying on Square as their primary payment processor. If something goes wrong, you may find yourself locked out of your own funds with no real recourse.

Very disappointing experience. I will be moving my business elsewhere and do not recommend Square to anyone who depends on reliable cash flow.",2025-12-22T16:52:23-07:00,app_store

tson23,1,Horribly,I’ve been a customer since the beginning. Built my business up t to processing over 100k in cards payments this year And never had a bad experience however over this past weekend they deactivated my account no warning or reason in the middle is work day this comes a month after giving My business a capital loan.  This isn’t my first loan it’s my 4th always been early paying back to. To make a long story short I like the app but if you were to ever have a customer service issue when you call all they’ll do is “escalate” your ticket but never follow through.  I was told since my account was deactivated I can’t talk to a manager. And the most recent tech support agent I talked to said after looking at my account and what had happened that I should find another merchant service with no explanation why.  I suspect that it was from the email they sent me that I was eligible to take bitcoin which upon filling out my account was triggered for deactivation a mistake on there part,2025-12-04T02:46:12-07:00,app_store

Before I knew it all my money was gone over $30,000 just taken from my bank account without any recourse or any way to stop. It. I switched all transactions on the square to chip and manual inputs. A client 50 days after me servicing his home disputed the charge. Square gave the money back. I disputed the charge with square I sent receipts. I sent pictures. They ruled in favor of the client.

KaM-,1,Use Venmo or CashApp instead,"Their technical platform is bereft of what passes for acceptable functionality.

I logged in to realize that a bank I have not associated with in 15 years was attached for my business, so I made steps to update the banking information to my correct account, while also disabling the “automatic transfers” that I had never turned on in the first place. 

What their system decided to do was send the entirety of the funds to the incorrect bank immediately; when I engaged their technical support for assistance, I was cited “company policy” instead of seeing an ACH process interruption (which is a standardized banking process intended for scenarios where funds are going to an incorrect account/location), and repeatedly had to retype the information already provided in the Chat transcript (which their support representatives could not be bothered to review).

I’m now out my first business payment from a client, as the funds are going to my now-divorced spouse, and I would tell anyone who operates a business that accepts credit cards to simply use Venmo or CashApp for your payment collection options, because this same issue was resolved in moments without having to be quoted “company policy” on why they would lazily not do the correct action.

I also was never given a process on removing old bank information, as there appeared no options to do so - again, both Venmo & CashApp make these actions easy to achieve.",2025-11-24T19:38:16-07:00,app_store
"Mr. White — Macon, Ga",4,"Effective, just expensive…","I’ve been using Square for a couple of years now, & I must say that I am 90% satisfied with their services; however, they charge entirely TOO many fees. They always seem to find a way to charge you for YOUR money. I also use the square scheduling, which means they charge me an additional $29 for that every month, nearly 2% of each sale as well as an additional fee to receive ‘instant funds’, and an additional fee if you want instant transfers. Therefore, you never receive the total amount of money that you charge for your services unless you pass the fees on to your customers. It has worked in some cases, but not so much in others. If they could find a way to minimize the fees, the app would be phenomenal. The only other down side is that whatever transactions you collect Fri , Sat, & Sun will not be deposited until sometime Monday.

The reason they are doing this is cause they are trying to force you to create a Square website. Unfortunately those square websites look like trash. So, either you look unprofessional when you're sharing the booking link currently or you look unprofessional when you share your hideous Square website. 

The other super annoying thing right now is that every time you open the app to look at your calendar, There is a pop-up happening that is forcing you to complete your set up.

I’ve been using Square for years, and I’ve watched them become increasingly greedy and less supportive of small business owners.

ACCOUNT DEACTIVATION,1,I’m extremely frustrated with how Square handles new accounts,"I’m extremely frustrated with how Square handles new accounts

After I verify my identity with my government ID and complete the facial scan, Square tells me my account is approved to start taking payments. So I begin setting up my account I add my menu items, organize my products, and get everything ready to run my business.

But the moment I try to process my first payment, my funds get put on hold and then my entire account is deactivated. This has happened every single time I create a new account.

I’ve tried multiple times, and the exact same thing keeps happening:
Square approves me after verification, lets me set up my account, then immediately shuts me down as soon as I try to take a payment.

I still haven’t been given a clear explanation as to why this keeps happening, and it has made it impossible for me to use Square even though I genuinely want to. I’m asking Square to actually review my situation, explain what’s causing these instant deactivations, and help resolve it instead of automatically closing my account every time I try to use it.",2025-11-16T02:06:01-07:00,app_store

I don’t understand why I wouldn’t be able to get this transaction and then I decided to verify my account so I could actually access the money because I assume that was the problem and for some reason they shut down my account without an email without any warnings without saying what I could do better Without any kind of interaction.

pelon-pelon-rico,1,Don’t trust Square with your money.,"Square doesn’t have your best interest in mind. They don’t care about what you do, who you are, or your goals you’re trying to achieve. They can and will decide to hold your money if and when they want to. Even if you comply with their request to verify validation for it, they will hold it for 90-120 days for no reason. My guess is that they are using your money to invest, buy assets, basically using your money to make money that you will see none of the profits or gains. The customer support team is a dumpster on fire, straight garbage, useless, and unsupportive in every way. They don’t care to listen, reason, interested, or curious. They tell you what you can read and find out for yourself, they treat everyone that same, like a number, they don’t treat you as a person that is making moves and taking risks. My experience with square has been nothing of ease or convenience, only full of stress, frustration, and anguish. Heed my warning., don’t use square at all. I don’t usually write reviews, but my experience forced me to write one to warn others and help others avoid the problems that square has made for me. Good luck.",2025-10-14T05:41:04-07:00,app_store

Bshsiznsb,2,Inconsistent and poorly guided,"So square is pretty good overall. But there are some really frustrating things that to meare just unacceptable. At a recent trade show, when trying to activate tap to pay on the phone, it would just error out and say tray again later. I kept trying because I left my reader at home, and I needed it to work. Finally when I get back, I contacted square and find out it needs to be activated on the main persons phone on their account. Some thing they could have easily said in the app to make sure I didn’t waste time and possibly lose customers. Also, setting things up like printers etc is always more convoluted than necessary, and when logging back into an iPad to a register set up that hasn’t been used in a while, even if that printer and iPad combo has been used before, it needs to be set up again and it doesn’t always remember settings. I am hoping the new modes works better, but again, these are things that can be done better, especially about tap to pay. There is zero reason that they shouldn’t have a pop up or message stating what needs to happen to get it to work, especially since it seems to be a common complaint online and I am sure a lot of people are having it caused by a similar issue.",2025-10-03T10:42:36-07:00,app_store

This complicates not only the receipt of funds but also damages business reputation with clients. My experience shows that even after providing all documents for my identification and proof of funds movement through bank accounts, there is no guarantee of proper account functionality with this service. On top of having to somehow return part of the payment I received for completed work, I also have to explain to my client why this happened.

Michele Coppola,1,Warning: Square withholds customers’ money without legal justification,"I have been subjected to abusive practices by Square. I received a legitimate payment for work performed, split into two transactions of $1,000 each. When I attempted to withdraw my funds, the company arbitrarily suspended my account without providing any clear justification or evidence of wrongdoing.

What is even more concerning is that Square has stated they will withhold my money for 90 to 180 days before returning it, which constitutes an unlawful retention of funds and an abuse of consumer rights. Such practices undermine financial trust and put customers in a vulnerable position.

I want to state clearly that there was no breach of obligations nor any suspicious activity. This was a fully legitimate, documented commercial payment. I strongly believe that Square should be subject to regulatory review for withholding customers’ funds without a valid legal basis.",2025-09-05T11:52:58-07:00,app_store
Rigo B,1,No Good for business,"I’ve been using Square to take payments, but I’ve run into a serious issue with how they handle customer disputes. Even when customers clearly lie about a service being performed, Square automatically sides with the customer. They don’t properly consider the business owner’s side of the story, even if the customer signed off on the work.

As a business owner, this is extremely frustrating. We put in the time, labor, and parts to get jobs done, only for Square to take money back from us without fair review. It feels like they prioritize the customer’s word over real documentation.

I hope Square improves their dispute resolution process and starts protecting honest small businesses as much as they protect customers. Until then, I can’t recommend them for service-based businesses where customer dishonesty can cost you big.",2025-09-05T00:03:38-07:00,app_store

It would be nice if the app had this built in so I don’t have to fumble with a calculator and I’m usually off by a few cents here and there.

All Hairr,1,Holding Funds,"I strongly advise business owners never to rely on Square for their business banking needs. Square has been holding my funds hostage for over two weeks. Each time I call, I am told the account review will only take 1–2 days, yet it has dragged on with no resolution. My account was flagged for review due to what Square calls “fraudulent activity,” most likely because of the volume of transactions I process—which is normal for a legitimate business. In the meantime, I cannot access the money I rightfully earned. Square continues to give me the same scripted responses with no progress, leaving me unable to use my own funds. Business owners should be warned: Square can and will freeze your money for weeks at a time, jeopardizing your operations and financial stability. I am filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, and I am prepared to escalate further, including filing a police report, to recover my funds. Please do not make the mistake of trusting Square as your business banking solution.",2025-08-16T09:41:17-07:00,app_store

AAMORELL,1,Terrible for small business startups,"If you’re up, start a company and you just started going into business and you need to accept payment go somewhere else TLDR: they put policies in place that make it impossible for small businesses to get verified I have had square account since around the Covid days. Never had an issue with the company. I even charged my own credit cards to myself for testing purposes all of a sudden instead of taking payments through cash app and Zelle I offer invoices to my clients that rent cars for me and square decided to flag my account and ask for business verification. I sent them just about everything they could possibly need and they started asking questions about what my website is and how do I show my presence online with my business. I simply responded with that. The online platform I used to use went out of business and I decided to try this on my own And one of the folks I worked with asked if he can charge his credit card. I set up an invoice for him to pay and not only did they not take any of the information that I provided, and I mean, I provided the contract a text message between me and the Client business documents for my company as well as my drivers license and they turned around and said that it was not enough and proceeded to close my account and now they’re holding my fundsfor six months",2025-07-12T04:56:14-07:00,app_store

Customer Service has been extremely rude and unhelpful. I am very disappointed. I know 1000% that the check is good. There’s no reason for them to sit on it. Lesson learned and if you are thinking about using Square I would not. I have made several referrals to them and I will not do that ever again.",2025-07-09T12:23:10-07:00,app_store

Super kitty to the rescue,1,Not recommended,"I live in a remote town and commuting to the nearest cash deposit location is more than 40 minutes one way. Half of the deposit locations are located in slums, in unsafe parts of town, and several locations are closed down. 
Several locations listed on the square app to make cash deposits have turned me away because they have no idea what I am trying to accomplish. 
The locations that I have used only allow $200-$300 deposits per day. Same locations seem to change the maximum amount of cash deposit based on the person taking in to cash deposit at the register. I find myself having to chase up to 3 or 4 places in one trip trying to make these deposits which never work because either the location is no longer in business, or the employees or managers have no idea that they are registered to take in deposits for square. And carrying so much cash on my person from place to place to include parts of town that are in bad locations puts me, a single woman, at significant risk. 
Final straw: Today, I called to ask customer service to let me know which location would allow me to make the most / max cash deposit in one transaction. 4 transfers later, all refused to get a manager or supervisor. 
Square does not care for their customers and their customer service agents are not qualified to take calls beyond the scope of their scripted and pre-programmed FAQs. 
I have a unique situation and I called to get a resolution only to be told that I don’t have a reason that is acceptable to talk to a manager or supervisor. 
As a small business owner, disabled veteran of the US Armed Forces, woman, and minority, the lack of support in square advertised services is dangerous and Square representatives do not care. I have worked hard like many entrepreneurs to get my business started and going. In under a year, 6months using a square checking and saving account, my Square debit card was hacked while it sat in my wallet, several attempted charges on the debit card. I followed the procedure to cancel the debit card and ordered a new card that never came in the mail. When I called to check, I was told the new card was never ordered.
I had a transaction that needed to be refunded. As my first time making a refund, the process did not complete (no idea why not) and when I called square to follow up, I was informed that there is only 1 opportunity to process a refund and if that doesn’t complete then there is no other way to process a refund. 
Taking the square route for business banking is the worst decision by far as a new storefront owner. Neighboring small businesses all advised against square but I gave it a chance- I had to borrow a loan for start up funding to purchase the Square Point of Purchase Terminal. This is the most stressful debacle as a small business in under 9 months with this new business venture. I do not recommend square to any business.",2025-07-03T14:09:31-07:00,app_store
eclectic fruity crafts,1,Slimy Company,"I am the owner of a new small independent arts and craft business called Eclectic Fruit Crafts. I had an account with Square and had bought their point of sale card machine for my first ever market at Pride without Police in Salt Lake City. I got through my market and went to transfer my $300ish dollars to my bank account. A few weeks past and I still hadn’t received my payout but I assume it just takes a bit. A few more weeks and I still haven’t gotten it and am unable to log into my account on the app. I call the customer service line this morning to learn that my account has been deactivated. I am told by an automated system that I should have received an email with all the information. I was not. Customer service won’t tell me why and won’t tell me how or when I will get the $300. They said they will escalate my situation to their account services team. I received this email from them this evening. 
So I try calling the customer service line and it’s the same runaround and them having no information, no way to contact the people who do know, and no solutions to any of my inquiries. I try the chat and run into the same problem. I have tried any way to contact them and so far I still don’t know why and I still don’t know when or if I am getting my money back. I am out $300 from the market and $65 from the point of sale machine. I am attempting to return the machine, but seeing as I no longer have the original packaging and it has been used I don’t have high hopes.
This feels like a targeted hit seeing as I am gay, trans, chronically ill, autistic, and vocally anti-ICE, pro-Palestine, and anti-police, and that the only market I had done so far was Pride without Police, a community ran function that is very leftist and vocal about their politics.",2025-07-02T18:43:50-07:00,app_store

Dillon Cummings,1,Beware!!! May Suddenly Deactivate Your Account and Hold your Funds!!!,"I had two transactions through square. The first one went fine then when the second one was sent, square sent me an email to verify myself. I sent the required information and they sent an email asking for further information. I sent over that information and in the same day received an email that my account had been deactivated. I called support and they said it was still in review and they would get it over to account services. The same day they sent another email that my account was deactivated. When I asked for the reasoning behind all this they refused to tell me and said my funds would be on hold for over two months. If I had to guess why it was deactivated, I would guess it’s because I wasn’t regularly receiving payments through them because most customers paid by check so square wouldn’t take a cut out of their payments. I would highly recommend to not use square.",2025-07-02T18:07:23-07:00,app_store
